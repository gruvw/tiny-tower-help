Each time you deliver a friend\u0026rsquo;s doorman in your elevator you will get 10 bux.\nFocus bux on upgrading your elevator at the start, since you keep your elevator speed when you rebuild.\nWhile rebuilding, only upgrade floors to level 3 or 4 depending on your activity so your stock can keep earning your coins while you are away from the game. All stores will return to Level 1 after a rebuild.\nAuto-enter can be worth it, if you are leaving the game for the next 8 hours. On average, it is slightly better value than using only bux for a 50-floor rebuild. Your odds of winning any given hourly raffle during your auto-enter period are no different from entering each hour manually.\nConverting bux to coins gets more cost effective on higher floors, so build with coins as long as you can and only convert bux to coins near the end.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t use Rush All; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t give a lot of benefit (unless you have a stock mission and it costs less than 10 bux to rush the last item needed).\nNever skill up bits (199 bux minimum). Only request for golds (0 bux) or send non-golds to Gfarms (5 bux per bit).\nIf you think you might someday buy the VIP package, don\u0026rsquo;t spend bux on aesthetics because most of those will be unlocked with VIP.\nBux Earning In order of what are considered to be the most efficient ways of getting bux:\nPiggy Bank In app purchase of Bux Friends visiting you.

Start any random construction on all the other floors so that the orange construction canvas appears. Move the Apartment to the top of your tower to take advantage of Melvyn. When a Find Mission pops up, all the objects/bits will be on the top floor because of the construction canvases. Do this for as long as you feel like, and then rebuild. While it may be just as easy to complete Find Missions right after the tutorial, it is better to farm for bux right before you rebuild. At 3 floors a Find Mission will only pay out 10 bux, but at 50 floors it will pay out 60 bux!\nSome players will farm bux by completing the tutorial and immediately rebuilding the tower to do the tutorial or first few floors again.\nYou gain up to 95 bux with each tutorial. If you continue to build to floor 7 you gain up to 30 more bux.\nJust 3 find missions at 50 floors will get you more than that, plus a gold ticket when you stop and rebuild.\nThe tutorial method also shows each 3-7 floor tower rebuild in your past towers list.\nFor an example, see https://streamable.com/dbtj4.\nBux Farming Rewards For \u0026ldquo;Delivery\u0026rdquo; Missions: Tower Height = Bux reward\n1-18 = 10 19-38 = 20 39-58 = 30 59-78 = 40 79-∞ = 50 For \u0026ldquo;Find\u0026rdquo; Missions: Tower Height = Bux reward\n1-8 = 10 9-18 = 20 19-28 = 30 29-38 = 40 39-48 = 50 49-58 = 60 59-68 = 70 69-78 = 80 79-88 = 90 89-∞ = 100 Bux spending In this server, we recommend you spend all your bux on the elevator motor before anything else:\nElevator rides in your tower returns coins based on this formula: F * (1 + G) * Y + 50\nF = floor reached, G = total GT's, Y = your elevator speed (including Lubed Tube bonus).\nFor all play styles, it is highly recommend you spend bux in this order:\nElevator Motor Commercial Floor Level (max level 3-4 if rebuilding) Purchasing floors by converting bux to coins Raffle (if not rebuilding) Cosmetics (if you\u0026rsquo;re certain you\u0026rsquo;ll never buy VIP) Never upgrade bitizens\u0026rsquo; skills with \u0026ldquo;Skill Up\u0026rdquo; (see Gold Farm instead), instant move in a bitizen, or rush anything.\nRush Rushing Construction Construction can be rushed with bux.\nThe cost is 6 bux/10 minutes (smallest time block) and is capped at 1000 bux.\nNote you can still rebuild without waiting for construction to finish (see Rebuilding for more information).\nCustomer Rush Customer rush is achieved through watching ads or sometimes awarded as an event prize.\nIn normal play it lasts for 20 minutes while the game is open.\nWhen awarded through an event prize the time will be shorter.\nIt is paused off-screen and will resume where it left off if the game is closed and reopened later.\nThe customers will only buy the stock you have at the moment you instigate the customer rush.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s no stock at all they won\u0026rsquo;t visit that store.\nIf your store completely runs out of stock before the 20 minutes are over, all the queued up customers will disappear.\nThey won\u0026rsquo;t come back when you restock a product.\nA bunch of customers will be queued up at each store that has stock and will buy 1 product a second.\nWhich product they pick is random based on what products are already in stock.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a little list of what a store\u0026rsquo;s base CPM contribution will be if you have the following products stocked during Customer Rush.\n/, /, 3: 180 /, 2, 3: 150 /, 2, /: 120 1, /, 3: 120 1, 2, 3: 120 1, 2, /: 90 1, /, /: 60 So, if product 1 is in stock and product 3 is ready to stock then put it into stock before collecting customer rush.\nBut if it\u0026rsquo;s product 3 that\u0026rsquo;s in stock and product 1 that\u0026rsquo;s ready to stock then hold off.\nIf you have a store that has nothing in stock but a product is stock then you should put it into stock (no matter what it is) BEFORE collecting customer rush.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/coins/","title":"Coins","parent":"Tiny Tower Help","content":" Elevator rides in your tower return coins based on this formula: F * (1 + G) * Y + 50 where Y = your elevator speed (FPS), F = floor reached, and G = total GTs.

Each bit in its dream job doubles the stock quantity for its product and pays triple rent. The formula for calculating rent per bitizen is as follows: First add up all its stats, for e.g. 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25.

Using a wise amount of bux on upgrading retail stores is key, as you don\u0026rsquo;t want to take away from your Bux to Coin purchases. lvl 3-4 is pretty typical to most game styles This is where having gts are key and you should always put your gts on commercial floors.

(although they will receive only 1-2 visits in a day).\nIf you get a low floor and are fast enough, you can click the X to cancel the visit and try again for a higher floor.\nFor a list of more tall towers, check out the Farms tab in the spreadsheet!\nFully Stocked Bonus Requires 1 golden ticket and can only be done while your tower is 3 stores tall. Move at least 3 bits into the apartment.\nBuild a commercial floor (see note below) Upgrade the store with the GT Hire the 3 bits Stock all items for free, so you receive a fully stocked bonus Unhire the 3 bits Delete the floor (it returns the GT) Repeat until you feel like stopping. This should give you between 5,400 and 8,500 coins each time (more if you have dream workers).\nNote: If not VIP, build random creative floors since they give higher Fully Stocked Bonuses on average. If VIP, build the Tattoo Parlor and keep Tattoo Parlor dream workers to increase the bonus to 15,725 coins (pre-tech tree). (Even though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the highest FSB, Tattoo Parlor is the most efficient since it takes significantly fewer taps than any better store).\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/cosmetics/","title":"Cosmetics","parent":"Tiny Tower Help","content":" Costumes Costumes are a great way to personalize your tower.\nUnlocking: When a bit with a costume gets delivered to a floor in your tower, the costume will be unlocked.\nRandom elevator riders will sometimes have a costume When a friend\u0026rsquo;s doorman visits you, their costume will be with them When a friend sends you a bit with a costume, the costume will arrive with them Requesting:\nIn the #gfarm channel on the Discord server In the Costumes tab of the spreadsheet: https://tinyurl.com/grd9wyl Pets Bitizens can adopt pets!

An additional 6th space can be attained through the Shared Living research on the Tech Tree. An additional 7th space can be attained through upgrading the apartment using 3 GTs. A bit can be moved in manually from the lobby to an empty apartment space, via a bux purchase, or from an elevator visit landing on the floor with a vacant spot. The Real Estate Agent VIP will fill all vacant spots when manually delivered to the apartment.

If your Soda Brewery is at Level 10 or has a Gold Ticket on it and has 3 Dream Job workers, you will receive up to 255,312 base coins when you send a Big Spender VIP there.\nFor this reason, many players will use their first Gold Ticket (or bux upgrades) on Soda Brewery.\nMost players will unhire the 3 workers while waiting for a Big Spender VIP.\nThis is just to ensure that you won\u0026rsquo;t accidentally stock the other two items, either by using the Stock All button or tapping those items in the store.\nSome players will stock the 3-coin item at all times (store will be lighted and you\u0026rsquo;ll at least earn some of the coins while you wait for a Big Spender VIP to arrive).\nOther players will leave the store empty and only stock it when a Big Spender VIP arrives (store will be dark and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a bigger lump sum from the Big Spender VIP).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just personal preference; either way you will get the same number of coins between one Big Spender VIP and the next one.\nExample: https://streamable.com/4ez7q\nSoda Brewery without VIP Get Soda Brewery When You Don\u0026rsquo;t Have VIP.\nImmediately after completing the tutorial:\nDelete the 3rd floor. Build a random creative. Repeat the above two steps until you get the Soda Brewery. If you do this before building floor 4, the construction time will be instant. If you already have a Gold Ticket, you may want to do the Full Stock Bonus version of coinfarming while you wait for the Soda Brewery to show up.\nCake Studio See also: Delivery VIP\nThe best store for Delivery VIPs is Cake Studio, assuming it is at the same (or higher) Level as all your other stores.\nIf your Cake Studio is at Level 10 or has a Gold Ticket on it, has 3 Dream Job workers, and already has some 2-coin and 3-coin items in stock, you can receive a Fully Stock Bonus of up to 50,802 coins when you send a Delivery VIP there (pre-tech tree).\nFor this reason, many players will use one of their first two Gold Tickets (or bux upgrades) on Cake Studio.\nThe MORE stock a store already has when you send a Delivery VIP there, the MORE coins you\u0026rsquo;ll get.\nYour second Gold Ticket should be used on Cake Studio as your first should be put on Soda Brewery and used with Big Spender VIPs.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","parent":"Tiny Tower Help","content":" Terminology These are the terms we use:\nBits: Bitizens, the residents of your tower Golds or Gold Bits: Bitizens with a max skillset (9 9 9 9 9) 9s: Bitizens with a 9 in their dream job\u0026rsquo;s category Dream Workers: Bitizens working in their dream job (a silver/gold star will appear next to the store/bit) Clones: Perfect copies of a doorman GT: Golden Ticket, won from raffle or by rebuilding at \u0026gt;49 floors GFarms or Gold Farms: Specially designed towers that upgrade normal bits to gold bits Storage towers: Towers that temporarily hold bits Coinfarms: Tall towers that can give you many coins when you visit them FSB: Fully Stock Bonus Bouncing: to temporarily send your bits to another tower to be immediately returned to you Basic Tips Rebuilding Is it worth to rebuild?\nYes, but it depends on your play style.\nIt is highly recommended to rebuild at least 2 or 3 times even if you aim to have all the floors.\nGold Tickets Where should I spend my golden tickets?\nThe first on Soda Brewery, the second on Cake Studio and the third onwards could be on your next best commercial floor (see Top Floors).\nWhy?

Do the double rent trick. Make sure all stores have 3 gold dream workers, and all apartments are full of gold bits working in their dream job. Try to stick to having 3 apartments for every 5 stores (pre Tech Tree Shared Living), go to requests to get what you need, and evict non gold bits as you get the new bits. Focus on investing bux into your elevator. Go ahead and spend some bux on increasing store levels so they don\u0026rsquo;t run out so fast, but your elevator speed should be your priority. Visit friends! Go to the #the_lobby channel on the Tiny Tower Discord server to collect codes of active players, add them to your friend list and visit them. Most will visit back. And each day they visit you back and you ride them up your elevator, you get 10 bux. Visit tall towers like Jartwobs KMSF over and over. You can delete and re-add the tower as many times as you want and if you cancel out of the visit for low floors (under 2000) you can get 20,000 coins per visit. Any time you get a Big Spender, send them to a store that only has the 3-coin item in stock (and hopefully a decent amount of it). The Big Spender will randomly choose which product to buy, but if only the most expensive product is in the store then he\u0026rsquo;s forced to buy it. Abuse Melvyn: Camp out at the top of your tower between rides and tap on him when he shows up. Enter the free raffle as much as you can. Once you have one, each Big Spender = up to 255k coins. Non-VIP Choose the orange Creative category for any new stores. They tend to have better stock levels, which means they\u0026rsquo;ll sell more stock while you\u0026rsquo;re away from the game without having to upgrade the level as much.

Don\u0026rsquo;t be shy to request bits; dream jobs are more important than the difference in bits\u0026rsquo; skills, so prioritize having all dream workers. If you\u0026rsquo;re waiting for a gifted bit for a long time, quit and re-open the app. Tap \u0026ldquo;Request Worker\u0026rdquo; button on the details page of the store to request those dream workers from your friends in the app. If you receive a bit named Return XXXXX or some other clear instruction, return or complete the instruction. Otherwise, do what you want with it. Post in the bi-weekly thread and/or join one or more of the friend circles on the spreadsheet to expand your friends list. Lobby Codes Some players put the following character(s) in their lobby name to communicate if they want their tower code shared, accept/don\u0026rsquo;t want clones or random bitizens, run a storage tower or bounce bits.\n( + ) means \u0026ldquo;share my friend code\u0026rdquo;\n( - ) means \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t share my friend code\u0026rdquo;\n( X ) means \u0026ldquo;I do not want clones or any bits at all\u0026rdquo;\n( D ) means \u0026ldquo;I do not want clones, I will accept random bits\u0026rdquo;\n( # ) means \u0026ldquo;I will accept clones according to either ( * ) or ( F ); I do not want any random bits\u0026rdquo;\n( * ) means \u0026ldquo;I want clones, don\u0026rsquo;t send them to anyone but me\u0026rdquo;\n( F ) means \u0026ldquo;I want clones, but fill someone\u0026rsquo;s request with my clone if it matches\u0026rdquo;\n( $ ) means \u0026ldquo;I will accept bits for rehoming back to the community\u0026rdquo;\n( L ) means \u0026ldquo;Long term storage; contact first and rename bits\u0026rdquo;\n( B ) means \u0026ldquo;I will bounce bits for rebuilds; contact first and rename bits\u0026rdquo;\nBit Giveaways A great way to help the community is by sending your unneeded bits to other players rather than evicting them.\nWhether you\u0026rsquo;re giving away 2 or 200 bits, there are several ways to do so.\nIf your bits aren\u0026rsquo;t all gold, consider using a Gold Farm.\nIt costs 5 bux to send a bit to another tower so keep this in mind if you are low on bux and/or still upgrading your elevator.\nIn-game If someone on your friend list has an in-game request for a dream worker you have, that bit will have a red notification circle (the number tells you how many friends are requesting it).\nYou can see this notification either by tapping on a bit\u0026rsquo;s details from their store or apartment, or by going to your Bitizens list in the menu.\nSpreadsheet In the Dream Jobs tab of the spreadsheet, read the instructions in the header.\nThen see if there are any requests for the dream workers you have.\nAdd the friend if needed, send the bits, and edit the spreadsheet accordingly.\nDonate to Storage If you are ready to rebuild and haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to send away all your bits you can donate them directly to any of the active storage towers at any time.\nSee the list pinned in info-discussion.\nGiveaways Channel If you would like to post a list of gold bits in giveaways you will need the new giveaway role!\nYou should at least have the visitor (orange) role before hosting a giveaway.\nTo get the giveaway role please tag an online moderator (Doorman, VIP or Gold) and ask them to assign you the role. This will be a temp role that will last for 6 days.\nAll giveaway bits must be GOLD (99999 skills).\nIf your bits are not gold a gfarm can help!\nOnce you have the role you will be able to post in giveaways, posts in this channel will remove after 5 days.\nList jobs in alphabetical order, and include count of bits even if you have 3x.\nBouncing Bits Bouncing is the term used to temporarily send your favourite bits to another tower to be immediately returned to you.\nFor example, bouncing is often done with gold Soda Brewery bits prior to a rebuild so the player can start the new tower with their own Soda bits.\nThe GFarms offer bouncing services and the process is the same as golding requests.\nHow to use a GFarm:\nRename all the bits with the friend code you want the GFarm to return the bits to. Go to the #gfarm channel on the Tiny Tower Discord server and tag @gfarm to find active GFarms. In your post, mention how many bits you\u0026rsquo;d like to bounce. Wait for an available GFarm to reply. Send your bits to the GFarm and if they were named with your friend code you\u0026rsquo;ll see those blue boxes appear in a little while. Clones If another player visits you and lands on an empty apartment slot, a bitizen that looks identical to their doorman (but with random name, stats, and dream job) will move in.\nPlayers call these bitizens \u0026ldquo;clones\u0026rdquo;, and many users will return them back to the friend who visited.\nVisit Bruce\u0026rsquo;s clone tower at code 99999 and a gold clone of your doorman will be returned.\nVisit daily and receive a clone back every day!\nSome players might put the following character in their lobby name to communicate if they want their clones or not.\n( * ) means \u0026ldquo;I want clones, don\u0026rsquo;t send them to anyone but me\u0026rdquo; ( F ) means \u0026ldquo;I want clones, but fill someone\u0026rsquo;s request with my clone if it matches\u0026rdquo; ( # ) means \u0026ldquo;I want clones, but don\u0026rsquo;t send me any random non-clones\u0026rdquo; ( X ) means \u0026ldquo;I do not want clones or any bits at all\u0026rdquo; ( D ) means \u0026ldquo;I do not want clones, I will accept random bits\u0026rdquo; Storage Towers See also: Multiple Towers\nA Storage tower stores bits, but there are two kinds: Private and Public.\nA Private Storage tower is usually created if you want to hold the bits from your Main tower during a rebuild. Putting the friend code for the storage tower in your Discord nickname will help you earn bux which can help while you\u0026rsquo;re building it up, but remember that a lot of players\u0026rsquo; clones will move in while you have vacancies. The ideal Private Storage tower really only needs to have 18 apartments since that\u0026rsquo;s about as many as your Main will have in a 50 floor rebuild.\nA Public Storage tower stores gold bits and redistributes them into the community by filling requests posted in the #requests channel, meeting in-game requests and the spreadsheet.\nThe ideal Public Storage tower will have all the apartments that can be built, though you can always \u0026ldquo;hold\u0026rdquo; extra bits in your gifted bit queue.\nStorage towers maintain stock from generous donations from other towers and gold farms.\nTo donate bits for rehoming send to any of the active storage towers pinned in info-discussion (see Giveaways).\nTo request bits from a storage tower go to the #requests channel and list what you need.\nAll requests are filled – sometimes by multiple storage towers so please be patient.\nIf you set up a Public storage tower you may want to contribute to the Storage group so that you will get notifications when other users tag @Storage.\nTo request the Storage role ask an online admin or mod for the role.\nVisits to Storage Towers and GFarms are encouraged as they assist in replenishing bux and keeping up supply of gold bits.\nPlease note you may not receive a return visit from GFarms or Storage Towers but they are appreciated.\nGold Farm A Gold Farm, or GFarm, can convert any bit (gifted bit, friend\u0026rsquo;s doorman visitor, random elevator rider) into a Gold Bit (max skill set of 99999).\nGold Bits pay the most daily rent.\nUsing a GFarm is much more cost effective than paying to skill up bits.\nYou spend 5 bux to send a bit to a GFarm and the GFarm player spends 5 bux to send it back to you.\nCompare that with spending 199 to 1791 bux to skill up a bit!\nIf you have a bit you\u0026rsquo;d like to keep or send to a friend (for its dream job, aesthetic, birthday, etc.), but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a max skill set, that is a good time to use a GFarm.\nHow use a GFarm Rename the bit with the friend code you want the GFarm to send the gold bit to.\nCheck the spreadsheet and go to the Farms tab or go to the #gfarm channel on the Tiny Tower Discord server and tag @gfarm to find active GFarms.\nIn your post, mention how many bits you\u0026rsquo;d like to send. Wait for an available GFarm to reply.\nSend your bits to the GFarm and if they were named with your friend code you\u0026rsquo;ll see those blue boxes appear in a little while.\nDo GFarms want visits ? Yes! Visits to GFarms and Storage Towers are encouraged as they assist in replenishing bux and keeping up supply of gold bits.\nPlease note you may not receive a return visit from GFarms or Storage Towers but they are appreciated.\nHow to create/run a GFarm Rebuild your tower so it has at least 1 GT.\nComplete the tutorial, and do not build past the minimum 2 floors.\nTake the gifted bit and send the bit to a normal appartement, upgrade the appartement to gold - upgrading all its Bits to gold - send the Bit to its owner, delete the floor, rebuild an Apt floor \u0026amp; repeat.\nUse the other floor as an appartement to hold at least 1 random Bit so you can delete the other floor as many times as you want.\nIf you build a gfarm and wish to help the community tag a moderator and ask about the gfarm role.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/others/","title":"Others","parent":"Tiny Tower Help","content":" Multiple Towers There are different ways to manage multiple towers depending on the device you are using.\nAndroid - You have several options such as Samsung Secure Folder, Xiaomi Dual Apps, Parallel Space or App Cloner.

Timing is important because it means that you have time to get your workers in their dream jobs / apply gold ticket to floors (if applicable) before loading up the screen and locking in the jobs. You take a look at the jobs and pick which one to accept first. The jobs are a certain quantity of any one item from any one commercial floor. The time taken varies, but usually it\u0026rsquo;s about 3 hours. It shows the amount of money you will receive from taking the job.

Repeat as many times as needed. VIP Cancelled Elevator Visit Aka. Infinite Friend Visit Trick\nNeeds:\nVIP package (auto lift) Minimum of 1 friend visit in queue Fast elevator (more coins) When you send a visitor up the elevator, as soon as they reach the floor and you see the coin shower, immediately go to the lobby and perform one of the following:\nMove a Celebrity, BS, or Delivery VIP into the elevator. Move a Construction VIP into the elevator if there is a floor being constructed. Move a REA VIP or gifted bit into the elevator if there is an open vacancy. After returning the VIP or gifted bit back to the lobby, if the visitor was a another player or a bit from an elevator mission, then that same visitor will reappear in your elevator shortly after.\nWith this method, you will receive coins from the elevator and the stock/construction time reduction.\nHowever, the game will not register the visit, so if the visitor was a friend, you will not receive the 10 bux tip.\nIf the visitor is an elevator mission, the counter will not go down.\nAn alternative method is closing the game to sync to the cloud, however you do not receive stock/construction reduction.\nThe benefit of this technique is that VIP players can extend the period where they have an \u0026ldquo;instant next elevator ride\u0026rdquo; while they have a friend/mission visitor queue, rather than run out of the queue and then have to wait random times for the next elevator ride.\nSo a great time to do this technique is when your visitor queue is short.\nAn extension to this for those players only building 1-2 apartments is the Delivery Mission Top Floor Residential technique.\nWhile any player can do this trick, there is no benefit for non-VIP players since the elevator wait time will always be random no matter what.\nDelivery Mission Top Floor Residential Needs:\nVIP package (auto lift) A delivery mission Minimum of 1 friend visit in queue Fast elevator (more coins) This is the same process as VCEVT, except instead of repeatedly using the same visitor, you\u0026rsquo;re repeatedly using the same bit from a Delivery Mission.\nThere is a theory that Delivery Mission bits have a bias toward apartment floors (approximately 25% probability), so if you keep your apartment(s) at the top of your tower, you can skew your rides higher which gets you more coins.\nWhile any player can benefit from having their rides skewed higher, for best results have 1-2 apartments (fewer floors to move), and have VIP with a visitor queue (so the elevator wait time will be nearly 0) and a fast elevator.\nTime Traveling Time traveling is not encouraged and results in:\nBits being stolen by a time traveling thief Fireworks disappearing until you reach the date you traveled to Rent disappearing until you reach the date you traveled to Tech points and tech tree progress may be lost Free gifts and ad offers from the freebux menu may not appear Stock disappearing Stock freezing (items are in the store but nothing selling so no coin earnings) Construction time being insanely high Stocking time being insanely high In certain situations your coins will go drastically negative If you have time traveled and suffered any of these consequences you can either wait until your tower catches up to the date you jumped ahead to, or dismiss that tower and start again with a new tower code.\nThere is no \u0026lsquo;fix\u0026rsquo; for a time traveled tower.\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/vips/","title":"VIPs","parent":"Tiny Tower Help","content":" VIP Types Big Spender: Buy out all of a random item in a shop.
