## Friends

* Rename your lobby to a name you want people to know you by, ideally your TT Discord name.
* Add your friend code to your TT Discord nickname.
* The best way to get players to visit you is to visit them first; you'll get 10 bux for every visitor you deliver in the elevator.
* Visit everyone who visits you; this is about a tiny community and you'll be happier.
* Pending visits stay approx 1~2 days and a maximum of 2 visits per friend.
* When receiving a gifted bit from someone, move the bit to an apt with at least one vacancy, not its dream job.
* Don't be shy to request bits; dream jobs are more important than the difference in bits' skills, so prioritize having all dream workers. See the ?bithelp requests command.
* If you're waiting for a gifted bit for a long time, quit and re-open the app.
* Tap "Request Worker" button on the details page of the store to request those dream workers from your friends in the app.
* If you receive a bit named Return XXXXX or some other clear instruction, return or complete the instruction. Otherwise, do what you want with it.
* Post in the bi-weekly thread and/or join one or more of the friend circles on the spreadsheet to expand your friends list.

## Lobby Codes

Some players put the following character(s) in their lobby name to communicate if they want their tower code shared, accept/don't want clones (?tthelp clone) or random bitizens, run a storage tower or bounce bits.

( + ) means "share my friend code"
( - ) means "don't share my friend code"

( X ) means "I do not want clones or any bits at all"
( D ) means "I do not want clones, I will accept random bits"
( # ) means "I will accept clones according to either ( * ) or ( F ); I do not want any random bits"

( * ) means "I want clones, don't send them to anyone but me"
( F ) means "I want clones, but fill someone's request with my clone if it matches"

( $ ) means "I will accept bits for rehoming back to the community"
( L ) means "Long term storage; contact first and rename bits"
( B ) means "I will bounce bits for rebuilds; contact first and rename bits"

## Bit Giveaways

A great way to help the community is by sending your unneeded bits to other players rather than evicting them. Whether you're giving away 2 or 200 bits, there are several ways to do so. If your bits aren't all gold, consider using a Gold Farm (?bithelp gfarm).
It costs 5 bux to send a bit to another tower so keep this in mind if you are low on bux and/or still upgrading your elevator.
In-game:
If someone on your friend list has an in-game request for a dream worker you have, that bit will have a red notification circle (the number tells you how many friends are requesting it). You can see this notification either by tapping on a bit's details from their store or apartment, or by going to your Bitizens list in the menu.
Spreadsheet:
In the Dream Jobs tab of the spreadsheet, read the instructions in the header. Then see if there are any requests for the dream workers you have. Add the friend if needed, send the bits, and edit the spreadsheet accordingly.
Donate to Storage:
If you are ready to rebuild and haven't been able to send away all your bits you can donate them directly to any of the active storage towers at any time.  See the list pinned in info-discussion.
Giveaways Channel:
If you would like to post a list of gold bits in giveaways you will need the new giveaway role!  You should at least have the visitor (orange) role before hosting a giveaway.
To get the giveaway role please tag an online moderator (Doorman, VIP or Gold) and ask them to assign you the role.  This will be a temp role that will last for 6 days.
All giveaway bits must be GOLD (99999 skills).  If your bits are not gold a gfarm can help (see gfarm)!
Once you have the role you will be able to post in giveaways, posts in this channel will remove after 5 days.   List jobs in alphabetical order, and include count of bits even if you have 3x.

## Bouncing Bits

Bouncing is the term used to temporarily send your favourite bits to another tower to be immediately returned to you.  For example, bouncing is often done with gold Soda Brewery bits prior to a rebuild so the player can start the new tower with their own Soda bits.  The GFarms offer bouncing services and the process is the same as golding requests.
How to use a GFarm:
Rename all the bits with the friend code you want the GFarm to return the bits to.
Go to the gfarm channel and tag @gfarm to find active GFarms.  In your post, mention how many bits you'd like to bounce.  Wait for an available GFarm to reply.
Send your bits to the GFarm and if they were named with your friend code you'll see those blue boxes appear in a little while.

## Clones

If another player visits you and lands on an empty apartment slot, a bitizen that looks identical to their doorman (but with random name, stats, and dream job) will move in. Players call these bitizens "clones", and many users will return them back to the friend who visited.

Visit Bruce's clone tower at code 99999 and a gold clone of your doorman will be returned.  Visit daily and receive a clone back every day!

Some players might put the following character in their lobby name to communicate if they want their clones or not.
( * ) means "I want clones, don't send them to anyone but me"
( F ) means "I want clones, but fill someone's request with my clone if it matches"
( # ) means "I want clones, but don't send me any random non-clones"
( X ) means "I do not want clones or any bits at all"
( D ) means "I do not want clones, I will accept random bits"

## Storage Towers

See also:
?tthelp multipletowers

A Storage tower stores bits, but there are two kinds: Private and Public.

A Private Storage tower is usually created if you want to hold the bits from your Main tower during a rebuild. Putting the friend code for the storage tower in your Discord nickname will help you earn bux which can help while you're building it up, but remember that a lot of players' clones will move in while you have vacancies.
The ideal Private Storage tower really only needs to have 18 apartments since that's about as many as your Main will have in a 50 floor rebuild.

A Public Storage tower stores gold bits and redistributes them into the community by filling requests posted in the requests channel, meeting in-game requests and the spreadsheet.  The ideal Public Storage tower will have all the apartments that can be built, though you can always "hold" extra bits in your gifted bit queue.

Storage towers maintain stock from generous donations from other towers and gold farms.  To donate bits for rehoming send to any of the active storage towers pinned in info-discussion (see ?tthelp giveaways).

To request bits from a storage tower go to the requests channel (see ?bithelp requests) and list what you need.  All requests are filled â€“ sometimes by multiple storage towers so please be patient.

If you set up a Public storage tower you may want to contribute to the Storage group so that you will get notifications when other users tag @Storage. To request the Storage role ask an online admin or mod for the role (see ?bithelp storage).

Visits to Storage Towers and GFarms are encouraged as they assist in replenishing bux and keeping up supply of gold bits.  Please note you may not receive a return visit from GFarms or Storage Towers but they are appreciated.

## Gold Farm

A Gold Farm, or GFarm, can convert any bit (gifted bit, friend's doorman visitor, random elevator rider) into a Gold Bit (max skill set of 99999). Gold Bits pay the most daily rent.
Using a GFarm is much more cost effective than paying to skill up bits. You spend 5 bux to send a bit to a GFarm and the GFarm player spends 5 bux to send it back to you. Compare that with spending 199-1791 bux to skill up a bit ðŸ˜±
If you have a bit you'd like to keep or send to a friend (for its dream job, aesthetic, birthday, etc.), but it doesn't have a max skill set, that is a good time to use a GFarm.

### How use a GFarm

Rename the bit with the friend code you want the GFarm to send the gold bit to.
Check the spreadsheet and go to the Farms tab or go to the gfarm channel and tag @gfarm to find active GFarms. In your post, mention how many bits you'd like to send. Wait for an available GFarm to reply.
Send your bits to the GFarm and if they were named with your friend code you'll see those blue boxes appear in a little while ðŸ™‚

### Do GFarms want visits ?

Yes! Visits to GFarms and Storage Towers are encouraged as they assist in replenishing bux and keeping up supply of gold bits.  Please note you may not receive a return visit from GFarms or Storage Towers but they are appreciated.

### How to create/run a GFarm

Rebuild your tower so it has at least 1 GT. Complete the tutorial, and do not build past the minimum 2 floors. Take the gifted bit and send the bit to a normal Apt, upgrade the Apt to gold- upgrading all its Bits to gold- send the Bit to its owner, delete the floor, rebuild an Apt floor & repeat. Use the other floor as an Apt to hold at least 1 random Bit so you can delete the other floor as many times as you want.
If you build a gfarm and wish to help the community tag a moderator and ask about the gfarm role.
