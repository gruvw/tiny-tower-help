See also: ?tthelp vip50

The game offers an in-app purchase for a VIP package. It is often available at 50% off, so if you plan on playing the game a lot it can be worth the money.

Here are the advantages of getting the VIP Package:

* x3 rent and fireworks
* Auto-elevator
* Instant 20 bux!! (no ads)
* Aesthetics for the roof, elevator and lobby
* Ability to choose floors. (Basically, you can always build the same top floors without having to search for the golds bits)
* No elevator wait time when you have visitors waiting
* Free pet adoptions
* Exclusive pets

### VIP 50% Off

NimbleBit offers the VIP Package at a 50% discount when you start a new tower, during the VIP trial, and at random times during the year. If you missed one of these chances to buy it at 50% off, you can force the sale.

* Be sure you have synced your tower to the cloud with an email address.
* Clean the TT cache (for some devices this means deleting the app).
* Open it again (or reinstall the app). If the game asks about a legacy tower, don't open the legacy tower.
* You will be offered the VIP package on sale because it's a new tower.
* Buy VIP.
* Go to the menu and click on the cloud. Enter the email address of the tower you synced to recall the main tower. Tap "Restore Purchase".
* Enjoy your VIP!!!

### Unlimited VIP

When managing more than one tower, you don't have to buy the VIP package on each device. You can buy the VIP package once and then share it across your devices that use the same Play Store/AppStore ID.

* Buy the VIP on your main tower linked to your main email (email1) on Play Store/AppStore account.
* Save the second tower in the cloud (email2).
* Download TT on your new device/platform.
* Set up your email1 on the Play Store/AppStore (to restore the purchase).
* Open TT and it will say welcome email1.
* Sync the tower with the cloud with your email2 and wait a little!!
* When it says restore purchase, click on it.

Your VIP should be active on both towers!
Note:  You cannot transfer the purchase of VIP between stores (Apple/Play).
Note:  Once a tower has VIP, the tower can be moved between platforms (iOS/Android)

## Piggy Bank

What makes it fill up?

* Whenever you deliver a bit, the bux in your Piggy Bank grows by the same amount as the floor number you landed on.
* Whenever you complete a mission, the bux in your Piggy Bank grows by the same amount the mission payout was.

What happens when I empty it?

* You'll receive the amount of bux shown.
* If the piggy bank was full when you emptied it, the cap will increase by 5,000 bux, up to the hard cap of 25,000 bux.
