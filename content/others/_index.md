## Lobby Codes

Some players put the following character(s) in their lobby name to communicate if they want their tower code shared, accept/don't want clones (?tthelp clone) or random bitizens, run a storage tower or bounce bits.

( + ) means "share my friend code"
( - ) means "don't share my friend code"

( X ) means "I do not want clones or any bits at all"
( D ) means "I do not want clones, I will accept random bits"
( # ) means "I will accept clones according to either ( * ) or ( F ); I do not want any random bits"

( * ) means "I want clones, don't send them to anyone but me"
( F ) means "I want clones, but fill someone's request with my clone if it matches"

( $ ) means "I will accept bits for rehoming back to the community"
( L ) means "Long term storage; contact first and rename bits"
( B ) means "I will bounce bits for rebuilds; contact first and rename bits"

## Multiple Towers

There are different ways to manage multiple towers depending on the device you are using.

Android - You have several options such as Samsung Secure Folder, Xiaomi Dual Apps, Parallel Space or App Cloner.
PC - Use an emulator like Nox or Bluestacks to simulate a new Android phone.
iOS - There is not yet a known way to use multiple towers on iOS other than using multiple devices.

## Useful Apps

* Use apps like Wakey or Awaker to prevent your phone from automatically entering sleep mode to get VIPs.
* Emulators: Bluestacks or Nox (don't attempt to sync a single tower on multiple devices if you don't want to lose progress).
