## Multiple Towers

There are different ways to manage multiple towers depending on the device you are using.

Android - You have several options such as Samsung Secure Folder, Xiaomi Dual Apps, Parallel Space or App Cloner.
PC - Use an emulator like Nox or Bluestacks to simulate a new Android phone.
iOS - There is not yet a known way to use multiple towers on iOS other than using multiple devices.

## Useful Apps

* Use apps like Wakey or Awaker to prevent your phone from automatically entering sleep mode to get VIPs.
* Emulators: Bluestacks or Nox (don't attempt to sync a single tower on multiple devices if you don't want to lose progress).
