## Delivery VIP

The best store for Delivery VIPs is [Cake Studio](/floors/#cake-studio), assuming it is at the same (or higher) Level as all your other stores.

If your Cake Studio is at Level 10 or has a Gold Ticket on it, has 3 Dream Job workers, and already has some 2-coin and 3-coin items in stock, you can receive a Fully Stock Bonus of up to 50'802 base coins when you send a Delivery VIP there.  
For this reason, many players will use one of their first two Gold Tickets (or bux upgrades) on Cake Studio.

The more stock a store already has when you send a Delivery VIP there, the more coins you'll get.

## Big Spender VIP

The best store for Big Spender VIPs is [Soda Brewery](/floors/#soda-drewery), assuming it is at the same (or higher) Level as all your other stores.

Stock only the 3-coin item.  
If your Soda Brewery is at Level 10 or has a Gold Ticket on it and has 3 Dream Job workers, you will receive up to 255'312 base coins when you send a Big Spender VIP there.  
For this reason, many players will use their first Gold Ticket (or bux upgrades) on Soda Brewery.
