The best store for Delivery VIPs is Cake Studio, assuming it is at the same (or higher) Level as all your other stores.

If your Cake Studio is at Level 10 or has a Gold Ticket on it, has 3 Dream Job workers, and already has some 2-coin and 3-coin items in stock, you can receive a Fully Stock Bonus of up to 50,802 base coins when you send a Delivery VIP there. For this reason, many players will use one of their first two Gold Tickets (or bux upgrades) on Cake Studio.

The MORE stock a store already has when you send a Delivery VIP there, the MORE coins you'll get.
