Gold Tickets (GTs) are obtained by winning the hourly raffle (enter as often as you can), or by rebuilding every 50 floors.

**GTs on Stores** - A total of 6 GTs can be applied to each store:

* Tier 1 (1 GT) will upgrade it to max stock with free instant restocking
* Tier 2 (+2 GTs) will increase the store's income by 10%
* Tier 3 (+3 GTs) will increase the store's income by another 15% (25% total)

**GTs on Apartments** - A total of 6 GTs can be applied to each apartment:

* Tier 1 (1 GT) will upgrade the bits on that floor to gold (skills of 99999), and any future random visits to the GT apartment.
* Tier 2 (+2 GTs) will increase the apartment size by 1 slot
* Tier 3 (+3 GTs) will increase the rent paid by the bitizens in that apartment by 25%

Other Features:

* GTs are also a multiplier that increases your elevator income.
* Every GT reduces construction and restocking times by `(GT + 1)`.

Floors don't need to finish construction to rebuild - as long as there is 50 floors displayed and the Rebuild button is flashing in the Menu it is safe to rebuild.

Your first GT should be used on [Soda Brewery](TODO/floors#soda-brewery) if you have it, or your best store according to the top [floors list](TODO/floors#top-floors).

If you rebuild or delete a GT'd floor the GT is returned to you immediately to use on another floor.  
They accumulate and are yours forever.

As Gold bits are so easy to access (see requests) it is suggested to put all GTs on stores until you run out of stores.

To see examples of the power of GTs check out the Elevator Build Challenge pinned in general.

## Raffle

The odds of winning are at least 1/250.

One GT is awarded per 250 entries, rounded up.  It therefore doesn't matter how many enter the raffle - the more entries, the more GTs awarded.

Enter the raffle for free every hour as often as you can.

Auto-entry costs 2800 bux and will give you an entry in the current raffle plus the following 7 raffle entries.  The auto-entry may be worthwhile if:

* Your elevator is already maxed at 10fps
* You have spare bux and no desire to spend them elsewhere
* You will be unable to manually enter for the following 7 raffles, eg while you are sleeping.

Purchasing a Gold Pass through the Buy More menu provides a button to enter the following 24 raffles with one tap.

If you win, a :raffle: box will appear in your tower - simply press it to collect your winning GT!  If you press a :box: before collecting your raffle the pop up message will be different

## Rebuilding

* Rebuild at 50 floors for the most efficient way to get a gold ticket.
* The first run is the hardest. Be patient and enjoy the slow cruise!
* Don't forget to join the raffle every hour! Rebuilding is not the unique option to get a GT!
* If you don't want your bits to be trapped in your past towers, send them to a storage tower or [give them away](TODO/online#give-away) to other players.

* When you rebuild, you lose:
  * Coins
  * Floors
  * Store upgrades
  * VIPs in your lobby
  * Bits in your lobby and apartments
* When you rebuild, you keep:
  * Elevator speed
  * Bux
  * All golden tickets
  * Friends
  * Rent and fireworks (if not already collected that day)
  * Costumes
  * Aesthetic purchases
  * Doorman appearance
  * Visitor queue (comes back after the tutorial)
  * Gift bit queue (comes back after the tutorial)
  * Raffle queue (comes back after the tutorial)
  * Melvyn (returns once your tower has reached 6 floors)
  * Tech points and completed tech tree progress (note you cannot rebuild while tech is being researched)
