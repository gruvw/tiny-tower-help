## Airport

Bitish Airways

1. It loads the missions the first time you go onto the airport screen in the day (beginning at midnight local time). Timing is important because it means that you have time to get your workers in their dream jobs / apply :gt:  to floors (if applicable) before loading up the screen and locking in the jobs.

2. You take a look at the jobs and pick which one to accept first. The jobs are a certain quantity of any one item from any one commercial floor. The time taken varies, but usually it's about 3 hours. It shows the amount of money you will receive from taking the job.

3. Once you have accepted the job, it will take the stock from the relevant floor. If you do not have enough, it will take what is available, and then you will have to go back to the floor to fully stock the item. Once the item is back in stock, return to the airport and click on the job you picked to fill it up.

4. You are paid as soon as the job order is filled up. The airplane leaves, and you cannot take another job until it has returned (at the end of the ~3 hours). You can speed it up with bux.

5. Jobs reset at midnight.

## House

Your doorperson can live in a customizable house next door to your tower.  The house, furniture and fixtures are purchased with bux.  Note the house is purely for aesthetic purposes and has no game function.

The first house floor is 25k bux.
After that, the cost is
`[(Floor#)^2] * 10000 bux`
So floor 2 is 40k
Floor 3 is 90k
Floor 4 is 160k

For those players wishing to create a special floor the dimensions are 128 x 46 pixels and tools used are the contact lens, pencil and marker.
