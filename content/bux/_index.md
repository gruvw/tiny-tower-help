* Dream Workers only pay their 5 bux to the first person who hired them in that job.
* Once you get to 19, 29, 39 etc. floors, your Bux for missions and deliveries go up, maxing out when you reach 89 floors.
* Visit friends who are active and return visits.
Each time you deliver a friend's doorman in your elevator you will get 10 bux.

* Focus bux on upgrading your elevator at the start, since you keep your elevator speed when you rebuild.
* While rebuilding, only upgrade floors to level 3 or 4 depending on your activity so your stock can keep earning your coins while you are away from the game.
All stores will return to Level 1 after a rebuild.
* Auto-enter can be worth it, if you are leaving the game for the next 8 hours.
On average, it is slightly better value than using only bux for a 50-floor rebuild.
Your odds of winning any given hourly raffle during your auto-enter period are no different from entering each hour manually.
* Converting bux to coins gets more cost effective on higher floors, so build with coins as long as you can and only convert bux to coins near the end.
* Don't use `Rush All`; it doesn't give a lot of benefit (unless you have a stock mission and it costs less than 10 bux to rush the last item needed).
* Never skill up bits (199 bux minimum).
Only request for golds (0 bux) or send non-golds to Gfarms (5 bux per bit).
* If you think you might someday buy the VIP package, don't spend bux on aesthetics because most of those will be unlocked with VIP.

## Bux Earning

In order of what are considered to be the most efficient ways of getting bux:

1. Piggy Bank
2. In app purchase of Bux
3. Friends visiting you.
4. Missions (see [Bux Farming](TODO/bux#bux-farming))
5. Fireworks (especially VIP)
6. Melvyn drops
7. Tutorial
8. Hiring a Dream Worker
9. A Bitzen's Birthday
10. Occasional 5 bux from elevator rides

If you don't like spending real money, 1 & 2 would be off the list for you.  
Friend visits play a huge role for dedicated players because not only will you be getting 10 bux every visit, you'll also be getting elevator income AND the occasional 5 bux.  
VIP package also plays a role on top of that as it not only give you triple fireworks, but also auto-elevator, making friend visits much more manageable.

## Bux Farming

When you are ready to rebuild:

* Delete every floor except 1 Apartment.
* Start any random construction on all the other floors so that the orange construction canvas appears.
* Move the Apartment to the top of your tower to take advantage of Melvyn.
* When a Find Mission pops up, all the objects/bits will be on the top floor because of the construction canvases.
* Do this for as long as you feel like, and then rebuild.

While it may be just as easy to complete `Find Missions` right after the tutorial, it is better to farm for bux right before you rebuild.
At 3 floors a `Find Mission` will only pay out 10 bux, but at 50 floors it will pay out 60 bux!

Some players will farm bux by completing the tutorial and immediately rebuilding the tower to do the tutorial or first few floors again.  
You gain up to 95 bux with each tutorial.
If you continue to build to floor 7 you gain up to 30 more bux.  
Just 3 find missions at 50 floors will get you more than that, plus a gold ticket when you stop and rebuild.  
The tutorial method also shows each 3-7 floor tower rebuild in your past towers list.

For an example, see <https://streamable.com/dbtj4>.

### Bux Farming Rewards

For "Delivery" Missions: `Tower Height = Bux reward`

* `1-18 = 10`
* `19-38 = 20`
* `39-58 = 30`
* `59-78 = 40`
* `79-∞ = 50`

For "Find" Missions: `Tower Height = Bux reward`

* `1-8 = 10`
* `9-18 = 20`
* `19-28 = 30`
* `29-38 = 40`
* `39-48 = 50`
* `49-58 = 60`
* `59-68 = 70`
* `69-78 = 80`
* `79-88 = 90`
* `89-∞ = 100`

## Bux spending

In this server, we recommend you spend all your bux on the elevator motor before anything else:  
Elevator rides in your tower returns coins based on this formula: `F * (1 + G) * Y + 50`  
`F = floor reached`, `G = total GT's`, `Y = your elevator speed` (including Lubed Tube bonus).

For all play styles, it is highly recommend you spend bux in this order:

1. Elevator Motor
2. Commercial Floor Level (max level 3-4 if rebuilding)
3. Purchasing floors by converting bux to coins
4. Raffle (if not rebuilding)
5. Cosmetics (if you're certain you'll never buy VIP)

Never upgrade bitizens' skills with "Skill Up" (see [Gold Farm](TODO/online#gold-farm) instead), instant move in a bitizen, or rush anything.

## Rush

### Rushing Construction

Construction can be rushed with bux.  
The cost is 6 bux/10 minutes (smallest time block) and is capped at 1000 bux.

Note you can still rebuild without waiting for construction to finish (see [Rebuilding](TODO/gold-tickets#rebuilding) for more information).

### Customer Rush

Customer rush is achieved through watching ads or sometimes awarded as an event prize.

In normal play it lasts for 20 minutes while the game is open.  
When awarded through an event prize the time will be shorter.  
It is paused off-screen and will resume where it left off if the game is closed and reopened later.

The customers will only buy the stock you have at the moment you instigate the customer rush.  
If there's no stock at all they won't visit that store.  
If your store completely runs out of stock before the 20 minutes are over, all the queued up customers will disappear.  
They won't come back when you restock a product.

A bunch of customers will be queued up at each store that has stock and will buy 1 product a second.  
Which product they pick is random based on what products are already in stock.

Here's a little list of what a store's base CPM contribution will be if you have the following products stocked during Customer Rush.

* `/, /, 3: 180`
* `/, 2, 3: 150`
* `/, 2, /: 120`
* `1, /, 3: 120`
* `1, 2, 3: 120`
* `1, 2, /:  90`
* `1, /, /:  60`

So, if product 1 is in stock and product 3 is ready to stock then put it into stock before collecting customer rush.

But if it's product 3 that's in stock and product 1 that's ready to stock then hold off.

If you have a store that has nothing in stock but a product is stock then you should put it into stock (no matter what it is) BEFORE collecting customer rush.
