## Costumes

Costumes are a great way to personalize your tower.

Unlocking: When a bit with a costume gets delivered to a floor in your tower, the costume will be unlocked.

* Random elevator riders will sometimes have a costume
* When a friend's doorman visits you, their costume will be with them
* When a friend sends you a bit with a costume, the costume will arrive with them

Requesting:

* In the `#gfarm` channel on the [Discord server](https://tinyurl.com/tinytowerdiscord)
* In the Costumes tab of the spreadsheet: <https://tinyurl.com/grd9wyl>

## Pets

Bitizens can adopt pets! Pets are a great way to personalize your tower.

Unlocking: Pets unlock much like costumes.
When a bit with a pet gets delivered to a floor in your tower, the pet will be unlocked so a bit can adopt it.

* Random elevator riders will sometimes have a pet
* When a friend's doorman visits you, their pet will be with them
* When a friend sends you a bit with a pet, the pet will arrive with them

Requesting:

* In the `#gfarm` channel on the [Discord server](https://tinyurl.com/tinytowerdiscord)
* In the Pets tab of the spreadsheet <https://tinyurl.com/grd9wyl>

Adopting:

* Tap on a bit's details
* Tap on Adopt a Pet
* Select the pet you want that bit to adopt

Hiding: If your tower is looking a little cluttered, you can go to settings and select Hide Pets.
This can be very handy when doing Find Missions.

### Exclusive Pets

Some pets are exclusive to VIP players and are automatically unlocked.

Though a VIP player can send a bit with an exclusive pet to a non-VIP player, the non-VIP player will only have the exclusive pet on that bit.  
The non-VIP player will not be able to select the exclusive pet for other bits.  
And if the bit adopts a new pet instead of the exclusive pet, they will not be able to select the exclusive pet again later.  
This is also true when a clone of a friend's doorman moves in with an exclusive pet.
