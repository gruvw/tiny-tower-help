## Residential Apartments

* The standard apartment houses 5 bits.
* An additional 6th space can be attained through the Shared Living research on the Tech Tree.
* An additional 7th space can be attained through upgrading the apartment using 3 GTs.
* A bit can be moved in manually from the lobby to an empty apartment space, via a bux purchase, or from an elevator visit landing on the floor with a vacant spot.
* The Real Estate Agent VIP will fill all vacant spots when manually delivered to the apartment.

### Bits & Gold Apartments

(see also [dream jobs](TODO/informations#dream-jobs))

1. All bits (including gifted bits) that are in a non-gold apartment before the apartment is upgraded will become gold bits after the floor is upgraded by a GT.
2. Other than gifted bits, all bits that move in after the apartment has been upgraded by a GT will be a gold bit.
3. Gifted bits can ONLY be turned into a gold bit if they are in the apartment BEFORE the floor is upgraded by a GT. That's why gold farms operate the way they do.

## Top Floors

Here is a list of floors in order according to their stock amounts: <https://tinyurl.com/y3p8g3pw>  
Some players refer to this list to see which of their existing floors has the most stock and will use it for the [soda trick](TODO/floors#soda-brewery) in place of the Soda Brewery.  
Players with VIP may want to refer to this list to decide which floor to build next.

The first top ten floors are:

* Soda Brewery
* Cake Studio
* Game Studio
* Ad Agency
* Film Studio
* Graphic Design
* Architect Office
* Wood Shop
* Costume Shop
* Robot Store

### Soda Brewery

See also: [Big spender](TODO/vips#big-spender)

The best store for Big Spender VIPs is Soda Brewery, assuming it is at the same (or higher) Level as all your other stores.  
If you don't have Soda Brewery and it would take too long to build it next, check the Floor Capacities tab in the spreadsheet, find out which of your existing stores is highest up on the list and use that in place of Soda Brewery.

Stock only the 3-coin item. If your Soda Brewery is at Level 10 or has a Gold Ticket on it and has 3 Dream Job workers, you will receive up to 255,312 base coins when you send a Big Spender VIP there.  
For this reason, many players will use their first Gold Ticket (or bux upgrades) on Soda Brewery.

Most players will unhire the 3 workers while waiting for a Big Spender VIP.  
This is just to ensure that you won't accidentally stock the other two items, either by using the Stock All button or tapping those items in the store.

Some players will stock the 3-coin item at all times (store will be lighted and you'll at least earn some of the coins while you wait for a Big Spender VIP to arrive).  
Other players will leave the store empty and only stock it when a Big Spender VIP arrives (store will be dark and you'll get a bigger lump sum from the Big Spender VIP).  
It's just personal preference; either way you will get the same number of coins between one Big Spender VIP and the next one.

#### Soda Brewery without VIP

Get Soda Brewery When You Don't Have VIP.

Immediately after completing the tutorial:

* Delete the 3rd floor.
* Build a random creative.
Repeat the above two steps until you get the Soda Brewery. If you do this before building floor 4, the construction time will be instant.

If you already have a Gold Ticket, you may want to do the Full Stock Bonus version of [coinfarming](TODO/coins#coin-farming) while you wait for the Soda Brewery to show up.

### Cake Studio

See also: [Delivery](TODO/vips#delivery)

The best store for Delivery VIPs is Cake Studio, assuming it is at the same (or higher) Level as all your other stores.  
If your Cake Studio is at Level 10 or has a Gold Ticket on it, has 3 Dream Job workers, and already has some 2-coin and 3-coin items in stock, you can receive a Fully Stock Bonus of up to 50,802 coins when you send a Delivery VIP there (pre-tech tree).  
For this reason, many players will use one of their first two Gold Tickets (or bux upgrades) on Cake Studio.  
The MORE stock a store already has when you send a Delivery VIP there, the MORE coins you'll get.

Your second Gold Ticket should be used on Cake Studio as your first should be put on Soda Brewery and used with Big Spender VIPs.
