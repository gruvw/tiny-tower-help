* Elevator rides in your tower return coins based on this formula: `F * (1 + G) * Y + 50` where `Y = your elevator speed (FPS)`, `F = floor reached`, and `G = total GTs`.
* Elevator rides when you visit a friend's tower return coins based on this formula: `F * T + 50` where `T = their elevator speed (FPS)` and `F = floor reached`.
* Each bit in its dream job doubles the stock quantity for its product and pays triple rent.
* The formula for calculating rent per bitizen is as follows: First add up all its stats, for e.g. `5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25`. Then take that sum, multiply by 20 (triple if VIP, triple if Dream Worker) and you'll have the rent.

## Coin Efficiency

As coins determine efficiency, in order of most to least quick, you can get coins by:

1. Bux to Coins
   * If you have lots of bux, this will be the most efficient at floor 14, and at floors 35 and above.
   * VIP (x3 fireworks) can be very useful here
   * Collect bux and coins from Melvyn as often as possible
2. Elevator on your own tower
   * In order to get the most out of your elevator, be as active as possible on the game
   * Additionally, having lots of friends visit you not only guarantee elevator rides, but it also gives you 10 bux
   * Riding someone else's tower's elevator will most likely not give you as many coins unless you have low gts and you're visiting a coin farm
   * Elevator rides in your tower returns coins based on this formula: `F * (1 + G) * Y + 50` where `Y = your elevator speed`, `F = destination floor number`, `G = number of gt`
   * This is where number of gts is important
3. Stock
   * Having a higher skilled bitzen will give you a discount, so make sure you've got your 9s
   * Having a non-9 bitizen who's working in their dream job (silver star) is even better than a 9 who is not working in their dream job as you will spend less time with no stock
   * Having a 9 bitizen who's working in their dream job (gold star) is the best.
   * Using a wise amount of bux on upgrading retail stores is key, as you don't want to take away from your Bux to Coin purchases. lvl 3-4 is pretty typical to most game styles
   * This is where having gts are key and you should always put your gts on commercial floors.
   * If you have VIP build according to the top floors list.
   * If you don't have VIP, build random creative stores as they tend to have the higher stock capacities
   * There's also full stock bonuses, SBC and CSC
4. Rent
   * Having all gold bits working the dream job gives you your maximum possible rent
   * Always do double rent trick
   * VIP (x3 rent) can be very useful here

## Coin Farming

Besides selling stock in your stores, delivering bits in your elevator, or collecting (double) rent, here are some other tricks to earn coins faster.

### Coin Farms

Coin farms are tall towers that ideally have an elevator speed of 10.  
The taller the tower, the more coins you can get each time you visit them since you'll earn coins based on this formula: `F * T + 50` where `F = destination floor number` and `T = their elevator speed (FPS)`.

For the first few floors after the tutorial, earning a few thousand coins is pretty helpful, so visiting people like Jartwobs (KMSF) with >2660 floors can be very helpful.  
You can delete and re-add the friend to visit them multiple times!! (although they will receive only 1-2 visits in a day).  
If you get a low floor and are fast enough, you can click the X to cancel the visit and try again for a higher floor.  
For a list of more tall towers, check out the Farms tab in the spreadsheet!

### Fully Stocked Bonus

Requires 1 golden ticket and can only be done while your tower is 3 stores tall. Move at least 3 bits into the apartment.

* Build a commercial floor (see note below)
* Upgrade the store with the GT
* Hire the 3 bits
* Stock all items for free, so you receive a fully stocked bonus
* Unhire the 3 bits
* Delete the floor (it returns the GT)

Repeat until you feel like stopping. This should give you between 5,400 and 8,500 coins each time (more if you have dream workers).

Note: If not VIP, build random creative floors since they give higher Fully Stocked Bonuses on average.
If VIP, build the Tattoo Parlor and keep Tattoo Parlor dream workers to increase the bonus to 15,725 coins (pre-tech tree).
(Even though it doesn't have the highest FSB, Tattoo Parlor is the most efficient since it takes significantly fewer taps than any better store).
